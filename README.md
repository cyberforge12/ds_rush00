# School 21: Rush 00 â€“ Piscine Python for Data Science

MovieLens Analytics

In this rush, you are going to work on your own analytical report. You will analyze data from the MovieLens database. By the end of the rush, you will have two files:
movielens_analysis.py and movielens_report.ipynb. In the first file, you will need to create your own module with classes and methods. In the second file, you will create the report itself using only your module.
